# Problem Description:
Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.

In each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1.

You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.

# Python 3 code below

class Solution:
    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = [0]*10001
        for n in nums:
            count[n] += 1
        a, b = 0, count[1]
        
        for n in range(2, len(count)):
            a, b = b, max(n*count[n]+a, b)
            
        return b
